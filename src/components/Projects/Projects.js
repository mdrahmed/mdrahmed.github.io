              description="In this fake news detection project, I trained and tested four machine learning models through their pace: logistic regression, decision trees, gradient boosting and random forest classifier. The logistics stood performed well. Its performs better for binary data classification. Decision tree and random forest of the models performed well too. However, logistic regression excluded those 2 with better accuracy and fast training. Finally, all three models were able to predict news whether its real or fake based on content."

              description="Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks are increasingly targeting modern factory floors, necessitating audit logging-based provenance analysis for safe recovery. To help solve this issue, I implemented ICSTracker, a physical process-aware, cross-iteration, and cross-domain approach to backtracking intrusions in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), using the LLVM compiler set, C++, and Python. ICSTracker automatically recovers the physical semantics of controller routines, reconstructs data dependencies, and associates controller operations with OS-level events, significantly outperforming previous techniques."

Noting the lack of comprehensive industry-wide sales visualizations for video games, I aim to fill this niche by creating interactive visualizations of video game sales data over the years. This project will feature a stacked bar chart to display annual sales across different platforms, with user-friendly options to delve into specific categories like rating and genre. Additionally, there is waffle charts to represent the percentage of sales, providing detailed breakdowns when users interact with specific sections."

After configuring xpdf-4.05 with AFL's Clang wrappers, afl-clang-fast and afl-clang-fast++, I embarked on a comprehensive fuzzing campaign to thoroughly test all components of the software. Then I embarked on the journey of subjecting xpdf to a barrage of mutated inputs in search of elusive vulnerabilities. While initial tests of XPDF version 4.05 showed no significant issues, further investigation revealed memory leakage problems compared to version 4.04."

This attack bypasses the need for continuous jamming, capturing signals once and replaying them at any future time, highlighting a significant vulnerability in contemporary RKE systems. The project aimed to understand key fob learning processes, analyze rolling code vulnerabilities, and propose countermeasures against the RollBack attack."

Various models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were used to analyze significant factors of cervical and ovarian cancer. The resulting algorithm, integrated into the Android app, aims to predict cancer risks and alleviate mental stress for women, particularly in low-income countries like Bangladesh."
