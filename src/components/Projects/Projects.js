              description="In this fake news detection project, I trained and tested four machine learning models through their pace: logistic regression, decision trees, gradient boosting and random forest classifier. The  gradient boosting performed well with prediction accuracy of 0.999000499750125. The other models like decision tree, logistics regression and random forest has accuracy 0.9985007496251874, 0.995750531183602 and 0.9985007496251874 respectively. Gradient boosting performed well because it is trained sequentially, with each new tree it corrects the errors of the previous ones. This allowed to capture complex patterns in the data more effectively than the other standalone models. Random forest and decision tree performed almost the same when trained with reduced set of layers."

              description="In this project, I trained convolutional neural network(CNN) model to predict images of dog and cat. At first, I tried to train the CNN model with batch size 32 without rescaling the images. But it was lot of overfitting. So, I rescaled the images and I got better and filtered it with 64 and 128 batch size. I compiled it with binary_crossentropy for the loss function. Then I trained it with 10 epochs at first, but it was taking a long time. So, I reduced the epoch size to 3 and got accuracy from 70% to 80%. There was still a little bit of overfitting, but the margin of error was reducing over time with the cross-entropy. At last, it was able to accurately predict real-time images downloaded from google."

              description="Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks are increasingly targeting modern factory floors, necessitating audit logging-based provenance analysis for safe recovery. To help solve this issue, I implemented ICSTracker, a physical process-aware, cross-iteration, and cross-domain approach to backtracking intrusions in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), using the LLVM compiler set, C++, and Python. ICSTracker automatically recovers the physical semantics of controller routines, reconstructs data dependencies, and associates controller operations with OS-level events, significantly outperforming previous techniques."

This project will feature a stacked bar chart to display annual sales across different platforms, with user-friendly options to delve into specific categories like rating and genre. Additionally, there is waffle charts to represent the percentage of sales, providing detailed breakdowns when users interact with specific sections."

After configuring xpdf-4.05 with AFL's Clang wrappers, afl-clang-fast and afl-clang-fast++, I embarked on a comprehensive fuzzing campaign to thoroughly test all components of the software. Then I embarked on the journey of subjecting xpdf to a barrage of mutated inputs in search of elusive vulnerabilities. While initial tests of XPDF version 4.05 showed no significant issues, further investigation revealed memory leakage problems compared to version 4.04."

              description="In this project, I looked at WhatsApp real-time chat data and showed how users interact in a group chat. I used a group chat where users talked about playing soccer. I went through the exported chat logs and found important correlations like how often messages regarding the game were sent and when people were most active, and how much each person took part. I used Python tools like Pandas and Matplotlib to make graphs showing these trends. The graphs showed how chat activity changed over the months and hours. Looking at each month, I saw that messaging hit high points mostly during 4-6pm. These findings can help us understand things like who leads the conversations, how people react, and how group activity changes with the seasons."
